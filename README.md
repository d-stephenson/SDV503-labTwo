Lab #Two

This weeks classes surrounded operators. Although I was somewhat familiar with operators I hadn't spent a huge amount of time looking at the practical application. 

The class sessions have been incredibly helpful, as most of my learning to this point had been theory. However, applying the operators in practice and seeing the outcomes has plugged a lot of the gaps I had in my understanding.

I had a reasonably clear idea with regards to Arithmetic operators and to a degree Increments, but I feel a lot more comfortable with both these and Comparison operators, which I had no practical experience with, but had a idea of the Boolean theory from our DAT502 class from the previous semester... the logic gates were also a nice addition.

The above journal is the sole weekly journal, there is no submission on the weekTwo submission.

I tried 3 different ways to come to the same answer in the submission. 

Cheers

Dale
